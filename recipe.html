    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Georgia is famous for its peaches, and perhaps one of the state's most
      famous recipes is peach cobbler. Making peach cobbler from scratch is
      really the best way to enjoy the dish, and besides, it's super easy to
      make and absolutely heavenly to eat. We don't need to special order
      peaches from Georgia in order to make this dish. All we do is pick up
      fresh peaches from our local grocery store or farmer's market and, in an
      hour's time, an amazing dessert will pop out of the oven. If fresh peaches
      aren't an option, then grab a bag of frozen peach slices, but if
      available, fresh is best. Peaches are already sweet on their own, but a
      couple more ingredients take them from sweet to “peachy.”
